		<h4>Relationship</h4>
	    <p>We unite people that would unlikely meet otherwise, building long-term relationships and trust. GroundUp intelligently suggests potential contractors based on patterns and trends from past completed services. </p>

      <div class="footer_container_box">
       <h4>Transparency</h4>
	    <p>We make it a priority to give clients as much information about their contractor as possible.
We allow people who have had work done with the contractor previously to rate their work, which determines their reputation score, and contractors can show their relevant certifications and licences.</p>

      <div class="footer_container_boxl">
		<h4>Customer Satisfaction</h4>
	    <p>We believe in quality work and to ensure that contractors conform to customer’s standards. We have set up our system so that clients deposit the money required for a job to GroundUp and be paid after the work has been performed. </p>
